# LuaBytecodeConverter

took me a while to figure out because im genuinely stupid. To whoever is getting into this type of stuff, I hope this helps you.

it takes lua code and translates it to bytecode, very simple

i have two writer functions for if you want regular bytecode or hex

hope this helps
